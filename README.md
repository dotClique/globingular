This is the repository for Group 2002's team project Globingular in the course IT1901-2020 of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. Globingular is a solution for logging one's travels, currently supporting country-level precision. As development continues, the app is expected to support:
- cloud-storage
- export/import-functionality
- achievement system
- trip route logging
- subdivion-level precision


## The source code

The projects source code is contained within the `globingular`-directory.


### Modularization

The project is split into several modules for proper modularization and allowing better reuse of code. Further details are found inside the [source-directory](/globingular).


### Testing, building and launching

Please see the [source-directory](/globingular) for details on testing, building and launching of the 


## Diagrams
A module diagram showing all the modules in the project, and their dependencies, can be found in the [diagrams-directory](/diagrams).

Class diagrams are within each modules separate `diagrams`-directory. For instance the Class diagram detailing the `Core`-module can be found in [globingular/core/diagrams](/globingular/core/diagrams).

Sequence-diagrams for the implemented User Stories are made and can be found in the [userStories-directory](/userStories)

## Issue and MR workflow

Issue assignee is the one who will write the code to solve the issue. MR assignee is the reviewer and is ultimately responsible for looking over the code that is to be merged. Please see [meeting-2020-10-28](https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/groups-2020/gr2002/gr2002/-/wikis/Referat-2020-10-28) for details.

## Work process

Our wiki contains team meeting summaries that effectively show our work process, progress, and problems throughout the project work.
